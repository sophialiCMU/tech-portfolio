title: About
---
I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate (class of 2023), with a passion for engineering in the fields of embedded systems and the intersection of hardware and software. I enjoy teaching, volunteering, and participating in hackathons, most recently one where my team and I created a smart pinball machine controlled by accelerometers, and another where we won a CMU entrepreneurial prize at CMU TartanHacks. 

I am the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) Mentoring Co-Chair, where I am growing a mentoring network for CMUâ€™s female STEM community while teaching incoming Electrical and Computer engineering students as a teaching assistant. My favorite projects are those in which I can use my engineering knowledge and problem-solving skills to expand the community of women engineers and scientists. 


## Current Role

Carnegie Mellon University Electrical and Computer engineering student. Society of Women Engineers (SWE) Mentoring Co-chair.
